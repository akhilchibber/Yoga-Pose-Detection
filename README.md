## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for a project focused on developing a deep learning model to classify images into different yoga poses. The project uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques to distinguish among five yoga poses including the downward dog, goddess, tree, plank, and warrior poses.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Yoga Poses Dataset" from Kaggle. It contains images categorized into five classes representing different yoga poses. You can find the dataset from [Yoga Poses Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niharika41298/yoga-poses-dataset/data).

## Pre-Trained Weights
The model uses pre-trained weights from the Xception model. You can download the weights from [this link](https://github.com/kazenokizi/defect_classification/blob/master/xception_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5). Ensure to place the downloaded weights file in the correct directory as specified in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Target Audience
This Github Respository, specifically the Jupyter notebook is structured to be accessible for beginners, providing detailed explanations and a step-by-step approach, while also encompassing advanced techniques for seasoned practitioners. Let's dive into the world of Yoga Pose Detection and deep learning!
