## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for a project focused on developing a deep learning model to classify images into different yoga poses. The project uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques to distinguish among various yoga poses such as the downward dog, goddess, tree, plank, and warrior poses.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Yoga Poses Dataset" from Kaggle. It contains images categorized into five classes representing different yoga poses. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niharika41298/yoga-poses-dataset/data).

## Getting Started
To use this project, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook. The project is structured into five main steps:

1. **Data Preparation:** Data is loaded, pre-processed, and augmented to prepare it for training.
2. **Model Building:** A deep learning model is built using the Xception architecture.
3. **Model Training and Validation:** The model is trained and validated on the dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Performance of the model is evaluated using the test dataset.
5. **Results and Visualization:** Training and validation results are visualized and the model is saved.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Numpy
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

These can be installed using pip (Python's package installer).

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib pandas numpy pillow
```

## Target Audience
This Github Respository, specifically the Jupyter notebook is structured to be accessible for beginners, providing detailed explanations and a step-by-step approach, while also encompassing advanced techniques for seasoned practitioners. Let's dive into the world of Yoga Pose Detection and deep learning!
